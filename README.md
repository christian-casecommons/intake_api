- Run ```docker-compose up``` from the root directory

* Configuration
- Check docker-compose.yml for system level configuration
- This a rails api app created with ```rails new --api```, so all rails configurations apply

* Database creation and initialization
  - run ```docker-compose exec api rails db:create db:migrate```

* How to run the test suite
- Run ```docker-compose run --rm api rspec spec```

Note: You can run any command from within the container by starting a shell session.

- If you want to start a new container with shell session, run ```docker-compose run api /bin/bash```
